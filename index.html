                    <p>
                        For our A-levels, we were required to complete an NEA (Non-Exam Assessment). 
                        This was a really important project for me, as I learned how to use Unity, 
                        Blender, and C# by myself. This is a first person, wave based shooter, where 
                        the objective is to survive for as long as possible nad gather as much 
                        points as possible. The game makes use of animations and models created 
                        mostly in Blender and my variation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.

                    <h3>NotFlappyBird Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was one of my personal projects that I decided to make for fun. This 
                        project was heavily inspired by 2013's Flappy Bird game, originally developed 
                        by Dong Nguyen. However, this game is infact "NotFlappyBird" and is a recreation 
                        of sorts.

                    <h3>Business Dashboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was a project that I have created for one of my modules at Queen Mary University of London. 
                        It is a business dashboard that allows users to create and view income statements. 
                        This was one of the biggest projects I did using 
                        Java.
